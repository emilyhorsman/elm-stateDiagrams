-- getKeyState is a function that takes a key and tells you the state it's in:
    --JustDown is when the key has just been pressed (lasts for 1 frame after the key is pressed; it always shows for 1 frame)
    --Down is when the key is contiuing to be held down
    --JustUp is when the key was just released (lasts for 1 frame after the key is pressed; it always shows for 1 frame)
    --Up is when the key is not being pressed.

--p1 represents the arrow keys and p2 is WASD.
    --p1 and p2 are tuples where you have (x,y).
        --a positive x value is the right arrow key (or D) and a negative one is the left arrow key (or A).
        --a positive y value is the up arrow key (or W) and a negative one is the down arrow key (or S).
        --a 0 in the x or y either means no keys are being pressed in that direction, or both are.
