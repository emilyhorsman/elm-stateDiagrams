{- A state diagram representing the autonomous mode of a robot in the FIRST
   Robotics Competition game, Rebound Rumble.

   The robotâ€™s goal is to score points by firing basketballs into hoops.

   Its autonomous mode must advance through the following sequence:

   - Rotate towards other robot on alliance
   - Collect additional basketballs from other robot (feed for 5 seconds)
   - Rotate back to starting position
   - Drive forward to shooting line
   - Aim at top hoop with camera
   - Fire until all basketballs expended or timer runs out
