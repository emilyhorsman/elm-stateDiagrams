--- make a list of the states and where to draw them

-- which is useful if you only want part of the diagram.
-- If states are to close together, you need to move the (x,y) positions.

--- define the transitions you will use

-- Here you define the transitions to draw, one kind at a time,
-- which corresponds to one ELM function at a time.
-- You specifiy the starting state for the transition, and the
-- location of the label on the arrow.  The library figures out
-- how to link the starting and ending states while going through
-- the label, but it doesn't guarantee that arrows don't cross or
-- labels/states overlap.  You need to move the (x,y) points to
-- make it readable.

-- Note:  sometimes transition functions are too long, so you can
-- use a short-form as the string.  For example, you could use "+"
-- for the function addTwoThingsTogether.

-- getKeyState is a function that takes a key and tells you the state it's in:
    --JustDown is when the key has just been pressed (lasts for 1 frame after the key is pressed; it always shows for 1 frame)
    --Down is when the key is contiuing to be held down
    --JustUp is when the key was just released (lasts for 1 frame after the key is pressed; it always shows for 1 frame)
    --Up is when the key is not being pressed.

--p1 represents the arrow keys and p2 is WASD.
    --p1 and p2 are tuples where you have (x,y).
        --a positive x value is the right arrow key (or D) and a negative one is the left arrow key (or A).
        --a positive y value is the up arrow key (or W) and a negative one is the down arrow key (or S).
        --a 0 in the x or y either means no keys are being pressed in that direction, or both are.
